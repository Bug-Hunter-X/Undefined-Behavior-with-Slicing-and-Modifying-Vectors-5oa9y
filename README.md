This repository demonstrates a common source of undefined behavior (UB) in Rust when working with vectors and slices. The `bug.rs` file contains code that creates a slice from a vector and then iterates over that slice.  If the original vector is modified after the slice is created, the behavior is undefined. The `bugSolution.rs` file shows how to avoid this by using methods that prevent UB, such as cloning the slice before operating on the original vector.
